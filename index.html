            <b>Project Goal:</b>
            <p>The goal of the project is to study the feasibility of developing a data repository for storing encrypted healthcare data (raw as well as curated) to advance research in understanding and eliminating healthcare disparities, and for training the next generation of researchers, especially from under-represented groups.</p>
            <b>Project Description:</b>
            <ul>
                    <li>A prototype cloud-based repository has been developed to store Protected Health Information (PHI) and metadata for the feasibility study.</li>
                    <li>The cloud-based repository will ensure that the data is easily accessible to all AIM-AHEAD researchers in a flexible manner.</li>
                    <li>The repository will receive all types of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data including EHR/EMR data, image data, synthetic data, sociological data, economic data, and demographic data.</li>
                    <li>The received data will go through the ETL/ELT processes before being stored in the repository. The stored data will be utilized for analyzing, identifying, and eliminating healthcare disparities.</li>
                    <li>The data repository will seamlessly work with the other three AIM-AHEAD resource centers (for Data Curation & Harmonization, Data Governance, and Open-source AI/ML Tools) as well as with the AIM-AHEAD Infrastructure Core.</li>
                    <li>The stored data will be categorized in different data marts for users to efficiently search and browse the repository and its datasets, as well as receive advice on which datasets are the most relevant for their research queries.</li>
                    <li>The relationship of this data repository with various other resource centers is shown below:</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Project Vision:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Once fully developed, the AIM-HDR repository will play a significant role in the application of modern AI/ML techniques to data-driven healthcare research.</li>
                <li>The complete design of the repository, along with the software services and APIs it provides, will greatly contribute to research on identifying and eliminating healthcare disparities.</li>
                <li>The datasets in the repository will include data on under-represented sections of the society, to provide unbiased datasets to the researchers.</li>
                <li>These datasets will span the entire gamut: synthetic, EHR, image, medical, socioeconomic, demographic, etc and will be stored in a secure, privacy-preserving manner.</li>
                <li>The repository will also support services that will help researchers, especially from the under-represented sections of the society, to develop their AI/ML skills in their quest to study and eliminate health-disparity.</li>
